# Time-Series-Forecasting-by-using-Elman-Neural-Network-Model

In the rapidly evolving domain of cryptocurrency, the ability to accurately predict price movements represents a significant advantage for traders, investors, and policy makers. The inherent volatility and unpredictability of cryptocurrency prices, driven by complex factors such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic indicators, present a formidable challenge to traditional forecasting methods. In this context, the Elman Neural Network (ENN), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), emerges as a powerful tool for modeling and forecasting time-series data, particularly in non-linear and dynamic systems like cryptocurrency markets.
This article presents a comprehensive study on the application of the Elman Neural Network model for predicting cryptocurrency prices. The ENNâ€™s unique architecture, fea- turing context units that store previous hidden layer states, enables it to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in time-series data, a critical aspect of financial markets. We detail the methodology for implementing the ENN model, including data preprocessing, feature selection, network training, and validation processes.
